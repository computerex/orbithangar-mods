# to run orbithangar-mods locally

You'll need:

1. Docker
2. Docker compose

Once you have these tools installed:

1. clone this repo
2. cd into the cloned repo directory
3. run: `docker-compose build`
4. run: `docker-compose up`

And that's it. It should take it a few seconds to start up. To test the API:

```
curl localhost:8066/api/addons
```
